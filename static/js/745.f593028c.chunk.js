I love having them, but I know that they are not the most comfortable shoes to wear for a long walk. Once I downloaded a mobile application just because it was beautiful. It was a habit tracker app with a stunning and inspirational user interface with gorgeous colors, shapes, and animations. Although it was not too functional, I enjoyed staring at it for a day or two, and then I forgot about it. On the contrary, I sometimes use mobile applications that are not visually appealing, but their functionality is irreplaceable. Moreover, when the market accepts one application as a standard, migrating to a different one becomes hard because nobody uses the other one.\n\n##\n\nYoung people switch apps at the drop of a hat if there is a substitute. My mom, who dislikes technology, saying it is unforgiving and sneaky, has slightly different needs than an impatient Generation Z user who expects a website to load within 10 seconds or starts pressing the refresh button. If there is a mobile application with an interface that young people complain about, I always wonder: how do senior users use it? Furthermore, do designers spend enough time listening to their needs and testing our products on them?\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b \nThe cognitive and physical abilities of humans change as we grow old. After 40, we may experience problems with seeing things clearly at close distances. After 60, it becomes more difficult to judge distances between objects or see in low light or adapt to bright light. Our perception of colors changes too. We begin to experience problems with distinguishing colors that look similar, such as pastel pink and pastel purple, or shades of colors close to each other. That is why it is so important to pay attention to the needs of all the users and not just the young and healthy.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\n##\n\nLet us not forget that our motor skills change too. In numerous usability tests and surveys, most senior users say they prefer touch screen devices over a computer. Using a mouse to reach a tiny target on the screen is easier if the hand is flexible enough, and moving it does not cause any pain or discomfort. We can assess how much time an average user would need to reach a particular target using a mouse, which increases almost twice in the case of seniors.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nA survey stated, \u201cOn average, it took elder participants twice as much time to complete movement tasks, but their accuracy was two times higher.\u201d However, the most differentiating factor between senior users and younger users is memory. Hiding information that was written on the previous screen and expecting users to remember it is not suitable.\n\n##\n\nMy mom often clicks everywhere on the screen, struggling to find the information or an icon she expected to see. We have been living in different cities for many years, so I can only support her through voice or video calls. However, even if it is a voice call, I usually know what to expect and which button she should press to solve the problem because I think younger people are more familiar with technology these days.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\n##\n\nAs the popularity of minimalism increased, many designers started removing icon names from screens. We could remove the names of some icons like magnifying glass, settings, reels, or camera rotation because its meaning is always easy to guess when we look at it, but often they are designed in various ways depending on the product. In this case, removing these names makes their meaning more ambiguous and misleading for senior users.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\n##\n\nThe interfaces these days have become more complex as they have to fulfill the necessities of the young users that want to \u201cget things done.\u201d At the same time, senior users can easily get lost in all the jargon, error messages, pop-up windows, cookie banners, ads, or some music playing in the background. All those elements affect our attention span and distract us, so why wouldn\u2019t they distract the seniors? \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nDesign improvements\n\n# 01 Improve the legibility\nGuidelines by various usability and web design suggest using fonts of at least 16px. All the critical text, buttons, icons, and error messages should be big enough to read without any difficulties. Pay attention to the contrast too. All the essential text and call-to-action buttons should be evident and distinguishable in color and shape. It is also recommended not to use blue if any interface elements are essential because they can appear blurry and fade if the vision is not sharp.\n\n# 02 Avoid splitting information\nSeniors exhibit different behavior patterns than Generation Z users. Seniors tend to read the whole text displayed on the screen instead of browsing through it. If the designer split the information across several screens, they force them to memorize all the details written on the previous screens. Hence one should always let them track their progress, provide feedback, and make sure that they can complete a task within a single screen, if possible. Ensure that all the navigation bars and icons are well visible and support the meaning of their titles. Senior users prefer to read text, so adding an icon to a title is more helpful than doing the opposite.\n\n# 03 Changing the layout\nLearning new concepts is more challenging as we age, so we should make interfaces that are easy to use and understand for everyone. Changing the layout of the apps frequently adds to the confusion of senior users. Avoid the layout updates if they do not add functional value. For example, changing the location of the menu or the icons can confuse senior users.\n\n# 04 Clickable elements\nMake sure that all clickable elements look clickable. Sometimes users do not know that an option exists because the call-to-action button does not look like one, so make it look like it clicks.\n\n# 05 Avoid motion\nAnimated text can add some originality and confusion if the user does not expect it to move. Static elements win in the case of senior users unless it is a video clip or a set of instructions.\n\n# 06 Make mistakes reversible\nThe interface should be forgiving. We all sometimes fat-finger a different button because our phones have become so thin and light that we can hold them in different situations and positions like sitting, lying down, walking, and above our head while lying down. All the call-to-action elements should be large enough to click them, and the most important thing is that those actions should be easily reversible if someone makes a mistake.\n\n##\n\nOne must remember the quote by Don Norman \u201cInvariably when we design something that can be used by those with disabilities, we often make it better for everyone.\u201d. Trends in the design world change all the time, and assisting users in their endeavors despite their knowledge and abilities is essential. Should we design one interface for all, and is it possible to design one interface for all?\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\n##\n\n## Thank You!",renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
