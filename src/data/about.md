# ABOUT ME

My name is Namrata and I am a UI/UX designer who is excited about creating meaningful experiences, solving complex problems, and delivering user-centered designs. With a background in software development, team building, and freelancing, I am equipped with understanding the needs of customers, clients, teams, and businesses.

# HOW IT STARTED

I transitioned from the role of developer to venture out and find meaning in my work. I pursued roles that took me out of my comfort zone and gave me a new perspective. During this time I came to realize that expressing my creativity is important to me. I also wanted a career where I can also apply my critical thinking. I wanted my work to challenge my mind and my views. My journey toward finding a fulfilling career, and my conversations with my friends and colleagues, led me to UI/UX Design which I fell in love with. It checked all the boxes: <br />
✓ Creative field<br />
✓ Requires critical thinking<br />
✓ I enjoy and have a knack for solving problems<br />
✓ Challenges the way I think and make decisions<br />
✓ My work is not centered around only myself but on other’s opinions and thoughts<br />
✓ Work as a team and as an individual<br />
✓ Can have a meaningful impact on someone’s everyday life<br />
✓ My work can be validated and improved on by feedback from actual users<br />
✓ I can utilize all the skills I have learned up to this point<br />

# HOW IT WAS

I learned to grow, and connect with people who dream big and believe they can resolve problems and build solutions that positively affect the global community.<br />
What first drew me to the field of HCI, and what has kept me interested since then is the foundational logic that underlies the theory behind designing.<br />
My working experience taught me to continue dreaming, scribbling, learning, and working with the best minds. I learned that no issue is too small to solve and too large to climb.<br />
I have designed applications that were intended to solve the problems that the users were currently facing. I worked and learned in a team of the best people. We asked questions and then constructed the solutions around them. We then tried to monitor the success and learned from the failures from the feedback the end-user provided us.

# HOW IT'S GOING

My reason for pursuing a master's degree in HCI was nothing but to continue to push myself to understand the complex ways how humans and technology interact with each other. This degree has forced me to lean on the cohort’s collective knowledge to tackle problems afflicting our global community.<br />
My goal is to work with people who are continually working to solve small problems that users face worldwide.
